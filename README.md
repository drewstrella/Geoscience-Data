# Geoscience-Data
A program I developed to organize, format, and interpret large messy datasets for the Geoscience department at USF


I was tasked with creating a program that would organize, reformat, and interpret large messy sets of raw data into a usable form.

Each raw data sheet that is generated is formatted in an inconsistent way, so the program needed to be able to adapt to any variation of the raw data.

The program launches a tkinter user interface that allows the user to select the file they need reformatted. The program then will generate a new file
containing the raw data, as well and the correted data.
